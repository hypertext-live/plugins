Plugin for [tailwind][].

Requires that the project `site` directory contains a `tailwind.config.js` configuration and the `assets/styles/main.css` tailwind source styles; see the `example` directory for some sample files.

Note you must be using node >= 14 due to the `colorette` package enforcing that version of node.
